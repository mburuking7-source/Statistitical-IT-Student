TOPIC 1:The Role of IT and Computers in today’s society

 -IT can be described as the discipline responsible for intergrating systems into existing analytic and 
    operational workflows.
-Across financial engineering,it refers to the full technological ecosystem needed to:
          >Store large datasets
          >Process them using appropriate computational models
          >Retrieve information rapidly for decision making
          >Transmit data securely across networks
-Computers are an intergrated system whose components collaborate to execute complex analytical 
   workflows.
  -The role of computers in financial engineering includes;
              >Running high speed option pricing model and algorithmic trading strategies.
              >Determining execution latency in high frequency trading systems.
    

Topic 2:Fundamentals of computer operations
   -Input-process-output cycle
          >Data enters the computer and is processed by CPU and the results are produced through output
  -Binary systems
         >0s and 1s
   -Central processing unit
       >Has the Arithmetic and logic unit and the Control unit
   -Memory and storage
        >Has the primary memory[RAM] and the secondary storage
        > primary memory is temporary while the secondary storage is permanent
   -Operating system
      >It manages files,memories,hardware devices and running programs

TOPIC 3:Basics of computer hardware and software
   1.Computer Hardware
   -Hardware refers to tangible and physical components
        >Input devices-Keyboard
                                 -Mouse
        > Output devices-Monitor 
                                     -printer
        >Storage devices-Hard disk drive
                                       -Solid state drive  
                                       -flash drives 
                                       -memory card
        >Processing components-CPU,GPU
        >Memory-temporarily stores data for quick access[RAM]
        >Motherboard

  2.Computer software
  -Refers to intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do
        >System software-operating system
                                       -Device drivers
                                         -Utility programs
         >Application software-Microsoft word
                                                -EXCEL
                                                 -Google chrome
                                                 -Games

TOPIC 4:Diffrent means of disk storage
   1. Hard disk drive-uses magnetic disks called platters
   2.Solid state drive-uses flash memory
  3.Optical storage-uses lasers to read/write data on disks
        -Types-CD,DVD,Blu-ray
   4.USB flash drives-portable devices using flash memory
    5.Memory cards-small flash storage used in phones/cameras
    6.External hard drives-portable HDD/SDD connected via USB
    7.Cloud storage-data stored in remote servers accessed through the internet

TOPIC 5:How to construct data files and examples
CSV
Text file with rows and columns.


Columns separated by commas.


Example: name,age\nAlice,30


JSON
Structured data using objects {} and arrays [].


Key–value pairs.


Example: {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}


XML
Hierarchical markup with opening/closing tags.


Example: <user><name>Alice</name></user>


Binary
Data stored as raw bytes.


Requires defining a byte structure and writing with a programming language.
Custom Formats
       You define the structure, separators, and rules.
Must document how data is stored.
